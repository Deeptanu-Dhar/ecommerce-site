Jack Richeson Sash Brushes are a real treat for the true landscape painter as the head is almost identical to those once used by the “Great Artists”. To work a large painting with one of those is a real delight. There are two different shaped heads, one is bullet shaped and one is domed. Both are marvelous painting tools and very inexpensive.
When we look at the Sash Domed 3/4 thru art history, we find that the early Old Masters had only one style of brush. They all used bristle rounds. Da Vinci, Michelangelo and the Dutch great used softened bristle wrapped around a stick. They worked and re-worked the shape and in doing so they softened the bristle.
Perfect for Mural Painting
Jack Richeson Sash Brushes enable anyone, regardless of age, ability or unique challenges, the ability to do remarkable work. These brushes are the most integral tools used in leading others through the magic of co-creating murals.
Pointed Sash Brushes
This is a marvelous addition to any one’s brush collection. The handle is designed for a good “feel” and it reduces the fatigue that follows many hours of work on a large painting. The Head on this brush comes to a sculpture fine point and will work well for detail. the Bristle is well packed and is held in place with an epoxy glue.
Domed Sash Brushes
This style is the closest to that used in the 1500’s. Its thick bristle build carries a tremendous load of paint while providing good control. Any landscape painter or set designer will love the way that it works. The bristle Is held in place in a brass ferrule by epoxy glue. The handle is well balanced and is a bit shorter than standard art brushes. It works equally well with oils or acrylics.

Golden Heavy Body Artists Acrylic Colors (with the exception of a few balanced primaries and blended colors) are composed from pure pigments in a 100% acrylic emulsion vehicle. No fillers, extenders, opacifiers, toners, or dyes are used.
Golden Paints original line of acrylic paint is known for its exceptionally smooth, thick consistency, and for its excellent permanency and lightfastness. Each color of Golden Heavy Body Artists Acrylic is formulated differently, depending on the nature of the pigment.
Colors that tolerate higher pigment “loads” dry to a more opaque, matte finish, while colors that are more reactive and do not accept high pigment loading dry to a glossy, more transparent finish. As these Heavy Body colors contain no additives, such as matting agents, therefore the gloss of each color will be different.

	('Drawing & Illustration','Staedtler Lead Sharpener for 2 mm','Description
This Staedtler Lead Sharpener is a rotary sharpener for 2mm leads. It comes with a large tub to hold lead shavings and a pad to clean the leads after sharpening. It can sharpen leads on their own or whilst in a mechanical pencil and automatically stops when the lead is sufficiently sharpened. Staedtler Lead Sharpener has two gauging holes: one will produce an extremely fine point for drawing, and the other a standard point for writing.
Directions for use:

Place the lead of the clutch pencil in either of the gauging holes. These are the holes marked with a triangle, either side of the circular white cleaning pad.
Press the end of the clutch pencil to release the lead into the gauging hole.
Let the clutch pencil clasp the lead again and lift the lead from the gauging hole. The lead will be protruding from the clasp, which will then ensure it is sharpened to either a moderate or a sharp point, depending on which gauging hole is used.
Place the pencil into the large sharpening hole and spin the lid of the sharpener round until it offers no resistance. At this point the lead will be fully sharp.
Wipe the lead-dust from the point of the pencil using the cleaning pad.
